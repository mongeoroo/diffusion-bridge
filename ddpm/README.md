## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, in Pytorch
Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</a> in Pytorch. It is a new approach to generative modeling that may <a href="https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/the-new-contender-to-gans-score-matching-with-langevin-sampling/">have the potential</a> to rival GANs. It uses denoising score matching to estimate the gradient of the data distribution, followed by Langevin sampling to sample from the true distribution.

This implementation was inspired by the official Tensorflow version <a href="https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion">here</a>

## Install

```bash
$ pip install denoising_diffusion_pytorch
```

## Datasets
Download the MSCOCO dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shtvkumar/karpathy-splits). 
Link the dataset path to "data/mscoco" 
For the data preparation, move to [image_captioning](https://github.com/mongeoroo/diffusion-bridge/tree/master/image_captioning)
(preprocessing coco labels and computing modality means)

### Training the distribution of text embedding.

```bash
bash ddpm/script_train.sh
```

### Inferencing text and vision embedding through the trained diffusion model.

```bash
bash ddpm/script_inference.sh
```
